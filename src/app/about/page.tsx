						WHO I AM
					</span>

					<p className="mb-8 dark:text-dark-gray">
						Hey! I'm Leo, a FullStack software engineer from the
						interior of SÃ£o Paulo and passionate about technology. I
						am {age} years old with <Timer /> of market experience,
						and I am currently studying Systems Analysis and
						Development.
					</p>

					<span className="mb-1 font-semibold text-onyx uppercase dark:text-medium-gray">
						WHAT I DO
					</span>

					<p className="mb-8 dark:text-dark-gray">
						I develop scalable and high-performance digital
						solutions, with experience in FrontEnd, Backend, and
						Mobile development. I have developed various types of
						projects, both independently and in teams. My experience
						ranges from Web3 and crypto assets to landing pages,
						blogs, management systems, e-commerce, news, and sales
						applications, among others. Additionally, I have often
						acted as a leader in development teams, reviewing code,
						architecting solutions, and guiding my team members.
					</p>

					<span className="mb-1 font-semibold text-onyx uppercase dark:text-medium-gray">
						AND OUTSIDE OF CODE?
					</span>

					<p className="mb-8 dark:text-dark-gray">
						In the rare moments when I'm not dealing with code,
						whether in personal projects or studying, I love
						watching movies, series, and animes. I exercise every
						day to keep my body and mind healthy, spend great
						moments with my friends, and pamper my Siberian Husky a
						lot. And of course, I play video games whenever I can!
					</p>

					<span className="mb-1 font-semibold text-onyx uppercase dark:text-medium-gray">
						MY FUTURE
					</span>

					<p className="mb-8 dark:text-dark-gray">
						I have great ambitions and fight for them every day. I
						want to be a reference in what I do and be known in the
						DEV community, aspiring to become a GitHub Star one day
						just like my idols. Moreover, I have the dream of
						working abroad, whether remotely or in person, as one of
						my biggest life goals is to live in Canada.
					</p>

					<p className="mb-8 dark:text-dark-gray">
						Let's build something amazing together?
